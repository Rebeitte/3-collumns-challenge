## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this challenge to reinforce my own knowledge about some basic topics, I had some issuies when I was trying to center using margin, so I had to recap some content about it. 

For this challenge I wanted to focus on improve my grid skills, that´s why I did each columns using grid. And I focused my coding in make it responsive thinking in mobile first. 


### Continued development

I want to focusing on grid, my next challenge will be a card/gallery while I learn more about all the css incredible world
